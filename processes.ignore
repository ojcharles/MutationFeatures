###### Features to potentially add, and those already ignored


### High priority
super secondary

moving average sequence conservation 2,5,10,20 res up and down





### medium - potential improvement
 - PDB2SecondaryStructure
    - https://github.com/realbigws/PDB_Tool # dssp
    - stride rather than dssp # dssp
 - residue-residue coevolution - look at distances longer than 50 residues



### low priority - already implemented well or something similar
msa2residuecontact prediction  - structures exist
    - https://www.conkit.org/en/latest/
    - https://github.com/AntoinePassemiers/Wynona
    - https://github.com/fusong-ju/ProFOLD
https://bitbucket.org/clami66/rawmsa/src/master/ - this looks poorly supported



### to check
    - check again DDG foldx is one but there are others on github , https://github.com/chaconlab/korpm
    - protein structure fragments, requires all are pre-computed, i.e. each protein considered as a group of structures.  https://turtletools.github.io/geometricus/getting_started.html#Generating-an-Embedding-from-Structural-Fragments


##### similar tools - look at feature space
# https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2527-1 - done
# https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2672-1#Fig1 - donee
# https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/W1/W535/6276913#267023810 # a  lot of specific tools that are similar to those already implemented
# https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/31/24/7189/2904390 - interesting method, would have to write it up - electrostatic surface
# https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025516304509 - interesting method, ,would have to write up, local PSSM



##### ideas
# what about a 3d voxel from the middle of each residue, where we generate an autoencoder?   https://iwatobipen.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/get-3d-feature-descriptors-from-pdb-file/    - prosite http://archive.simtk.org/wtorng/FSCNN_models/PROSITE/
# physicochemical moving average 3 and 5 residues?
# pfam or similar to idetify functional residues - pfam https://www.biostars.org/p/214726/



##### potential improved features on those already implemented
Deep embedding - we use https://github.com/sacdallago/bio_embeddings
    - one that works     https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans/blob/master/Embedding/PyTorch/Advanced/ProtBert-BFD.ipynb
    - ok so this will be impossible to do for each possible mutation, instead just calculate er wt residue
    - esm also   https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm
 -   for each column get the mean of the physicochemical features along that residue vector as in  # https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-10-S1-S1
 netsurfp3 - webserver is fast https://dtu.biolib.com/NetSurfP-3/



##### when we implement a subset pipeline - there wll be very expensive things to do, can't do it on 40,000 things.
https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/19/2936/2196551
https://github.com/yfCuiFaith/DeepCSeqSite - would require retraining



####### more compute heavy calculation to use when provided  alsit of mutations

###### ignore for reasons
# https://github.com/djparente/coevol-utils # plmc 
# https://github.com/KIT-MBS/pydca # plmc instead
# https://github.com/fusong-ju/ProFOLD # requires pyrosetta skip for now
# https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/33/suppl_1/D269/2505413 # we cover all these :)
# https://github.com/StanIsAdmin/PyProt # nothing
# disopred - seq2disorder , currently using metapredict
# iupred - seq2disorder , currently using metapredict
# https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/master/Bio/PDB/ResidueDepth.py  - essentially inverts a asa/rsa calculation.
 - https://mizuguchilab.org/joy/ # effortful licensing
 - tools by DJ http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/ # nothing new, perhaps some small iteration
 - https://github.com/allydunham/deepscanscape  - deep mutational scannign is a lab based experiment, this is just the data analysis
