Solvent-Accessibility-modified Tanford-Kirkwood calculations are an attempt to 
calculate electrostatic potentials and pKa values of ionizable groups in a 
macromolecule.  All interactions are simulated as occuring between charges at
(or near) the surface of a sphere of low dielectric constant (Dint) embedded in 
a medium of high dielectric constant (Dext).  The sphere is defined by radius 
"a" and a radius from which ions are excluded "b" (usually a + 2 angstroms).  
Charges are buried depth "d" below the surface of the sphere.  Electrostatic 
potentials between charges at different angular separations in the sphere are
calculated using an analytical solution to the Poisson equation (Tanford &
Kirkwood, (1957), JACS, 79(20):5333-5339). 

This program adds an empirical correction that improves agreement between 
experimental and computed pKa value: each electrostatic potential is weighted 
by (1 - average(sa_i,sa_j)) where sa_i and sa_j are the solvent accessibilities
of group i and j.  The work is described in detail in: Matthew JB, Gurd FR,
Garcia-Moreno B, Flanagan MA, March KL, Shire SJ. "pH-dependent processes in
proteins." CRC Crit Rev Biochem. 1985;18(2):91-197.

Compiling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fortran programs in this directory were written in 1988 by Bertrand Garcia-
Moreno E.  To compile them, alter the F77 variable in "Makefile" to point to a
valid fortran compiler binary.  Then run "make" in this directory.  This has
been tested using the gnu compilers.
